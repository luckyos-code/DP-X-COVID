# Privacy-Preserving Detection of COVID-19 in X-Ray Images

Chest X-rays enable a fast and safe diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients. Machine Learning (ML) methods can support medical professionals by classifying the large numbers of images. The amount of data needed for training such classifiers poses problems due to clinical data privacy regulations, which present strict limitations to data sharing between hospitals. Specifically, the models resulting from ML are vulnerable to attacks and can compromise data integrity by leaking details about their training data. Privacy-Preserving ML (PPML) offers methods to create private models, enabling development of medical applications while maintaining patient privacy. The goal of this work is implementing an image classifier for X-ray images, trained by applying PPML procedures to produce a private model and by that preventing attacks from causing data leakage.
